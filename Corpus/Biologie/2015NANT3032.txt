Our study focuses on the way individual, collective and social representations of social actors are constructed as a discursive phenomenon. The study allows us, via the theoretical model of the semantics of argumentative possibilities (SAP) and a perspective that integrates interdiscursivity into the analysis, model, to take into account the lexical meaning of the Spanish word "identidad" (identity). The thematic is focused on the issue of identity within the meaning of the identitarian. We provide a historical background of the discursive formation of the notion of identity. We study the etymology of this word and conduct a diachronic and synchronic study of the language dictionary's articles at the interface of historical seamntics and lexical and argumentative semantics. The corpus in which the argumentative deployments (AD) are studied is a heterogeneous one : the discourse of the Constitution, of the General Educational Law, of the Education directives, etc. ,
